I am giving you a sequence of pages directly out of a manga.
Please write me a SHORT, CONCISE summary of all the pages in a story-telling tone (MAXIMUM 200 WORDS). 
I don't want you to invent new things, just summarize what is happening in the pages provided. 

Your final summary should stick to the plot without over embellishing. The summary you write should be shorter than a minute of reading time.

REQUIRED: Please include in-line citations to the relevant image you are referring to in the format of `[^{image_index}]`. 
The `image_index` is the index of the image in the sequence of pages you are summarizing, NOT the page number written on the image. 
People will DIE if you cite the incorrect `image_index`.

If you'd like to provide multiple `image_index` citations next to each other, simply write them all in sequence, like this: `[^{image_index1}][^{image_index2}][^{image_index3}]`.

SUPER IMPORTANT: Sprinkle in direct quotes from particularly intense parts in your storytelling.
REQUIRED: Every direct quote MUST have an `image_index` citation.

The result should be a summary of all of the chapters including the new one I gave you, that is roughly the same length as the summary above.

KEY_PAGE_IDENTIFICATION_INSTRUCTIONS = """
You are given 20 pages from a manga (indexed 0-19, in order). Your job is to detect if any of the pages are 
1. A character profile page, detailing an introduction of the key characters in the manga
2. A chapter start page, implying the start of a new chapter

If any of the pages given to you contain one of those two things, please return the index of the page and the type of page it is ("profile" or "chapter").
There can be multiple profile pages and chapter pages.

Your response must be in the following format:
{"important_pages": Array<{"image_index": int 0-19, "type": "profile" | "chapter"}>}

Example:
```
{
    "important_pages": [
        {"image_index": 0, "type": "profile"},
        {"image_index": 17, "type": "chapter"}
    ]
}
```

If none of the pages contain a character profile or chapter start, return an empty array:
```
{
    "important_pages": []
}
```

Please respond with nothing else other than a properly formatted JSON object. If you fail to do so, people will die.
